This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">Read More ...</a></p></div><div class="comm"><h2>What is a cryptographic hash function?</h2><p>A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of an arbitrary size (often called the &quot;message&quot;) to a bit array of a fixed size (the &quot;hash value&quot;, &quot;hash&quot;, or &quot;message digest&quot;). It is a one-way function, that is, a function for which it is practically infeasible to invert or reverse the computation. Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match, or use a rainbow table of matched hashes. Cryptographic hash functions are a basic tool of modern cryptography.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">Read More ...</a></p></div><div class="comm"><h2>SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-224)</h2><p>SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm - 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001. They are built using the Merkle-Damgard construction, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies-Mayer structure from a specialized black cipher<!-- --> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">Read More ...</a></p></div><div class="comm"><h2>MD5</h2><p>The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a cryptographically broken but still widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption. It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes, for example for determining the partition for a particular key in a partitioned database, and may be preferred due to lower computational requirements than more recent Secure Hash Algorithms algorithms.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">Read More ...</a></p></div><div class="footer">Source: Wikipedia</div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/help","query":{},"buildId":"Y9EDNvDBnpIIfUw3uOprV","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
